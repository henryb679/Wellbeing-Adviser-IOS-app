# Wellbeing Adviser


This application will be built natively in IOS initially following some tutorials online as a framework then build it into a fully functional application at the end.


## Purpose of This

As I have recently got a Huawei smartwatch and found the application "Huawei health" to lack functionality, I hope to see what information is collected from the respective sensors and explore what sort of data values I can get for personal benefit.

Another plus of this is it gives me the ability to develop my first native IOS app.

* Feature sets to implement

  * Bluetooth connectivity from the wearable device to the app.
  * Populate data from sensors in a graph like structure.
  * Push information from sensors to the cloud.
  * Responsive design to work with different iPhone screen sizes.
  * Other features will be added to the list as required.
